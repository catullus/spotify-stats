### Most Songs Played in One Day

  - This would include skipping a song after, say, 3-10 seconds
      - Could filter out results that are less than 30 seconds to 1
        minute

<!-- end list -->

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 2

    ## 10 2021-07-08   155

``` r
## this is SQLITE syntax, other SQL might use "LEFT(endTime, 10)"
# temporarily create a column named date, use that to group by...COUNT doesn't work on aliases I guess
dbGetQuery(con, 'SELECT substr(endTime, 1, 10) AS date, COUNT(endTime) AS count, SUM(msPlayed) as songTime
                 FROM StreamingHistory
                 GROUP BY date
                 ORDER BY count DESC
                 LIMIT 10')
```

### Of top 10 listened to artists, over what time period did I listen to them the most?

  - Counts of that artist per endDate through time

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# stream_data %>% mutate(date = str_sub(endTime, 1, 10)) %>% 
#     # this is a shortcut subquery, technically
#     filter(artistName %in% res_freq_artists$artistName) %>% 
#     # 
#     group_by(date, artistName) %>% 
#     count %>% 
#     arrange(desc(n))

#ggplotly(
    stream_data %>% mutate(date = str_sub(endTime, 1, 10)) %>% 
    # this is a shortcut subquery, technically
    # filter out song listens that are less than 1 minute in length
    filter(artistName %in% res_freq_artists$artistName & msPlayed > (60 * 1000)) %>% 
    group_by(date, artistName) %>% 
    count %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.Date(date), y = n, group = artistName, color = artistName)) +
    geom_line() + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "months" , date_labels = "%b-%y") +
    xlab('Month-Year') + 
    ylab('Number of Song Listens (> 60 seconds)') + 
    ggtitle('Top 10 Artists of the Year: Number of Listens Per Day')
```
